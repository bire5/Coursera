Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Coursera Peer-graded Assignment For Week 4 

Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set


Files Included
README.md: An instructional document which explains how the scripts work and how they are related.

CodeBook.md a document that explains descriptively the variables, the data and all transofrmation performed to arrive at the required clean data.

run_analysis.R: the R script that contains the codes which are used to create variables,
manipulate the raw datasets and execute functions according to the five steps described in the project outline to arrive at the clean data.
The run_analysis was preceeded by the file download and prepation, codes for which are not part of the requirement for submission.
The 5 steps include the following as in the order below:

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The outcome of 5 steps above is then exported as final_data.txt.
